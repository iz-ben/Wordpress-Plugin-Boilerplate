# Wordpress Plugin Boilerplate


A wordpress utility template for generating wordpress plugin projects.

Supports namespacing and also sets up the css preprocessor you prefer, SASS or LESS.

Requires Nodejs and grunt init to generate the plugin in your prefered folder.

Once done coding the plugin you can run a `grunt dist` command to generate a cleaned up version of the plugin without the .less & .sass files and folders.

Enjoy
